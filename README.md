In order to obtain accurate results in executing the assembly function, Query Performance Counter was utilized to acquire the execution time in microseconds, and the average time was calculated by running the function 30 times. As seen from the average time taken in the table above, it is clear that assembly execution in calculating is a bit faster than the C execution. This shows that programs executed in assembly are most likely to be faster than C programs.


## Output
Take a screenshot of the program output with the correctness check.
